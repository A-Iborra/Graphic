In 1979 or '80 - I had a PL/I class - one of the assignments was to write an algebraic expression parser that could provide numeric results from string expressions.

I have pretty much been using it ever since. Other than the conversion from PL/I to C++ - it has hardly changed. though now - it has the ability to define and remember variables, for example, any expression of the form:

     v = <expression>

Defines the variable v. Any number of independent variables (dimensions) are allowed, and as far as I have experienced, it has always been correct !
