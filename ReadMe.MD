# The InnoVisioNate Graphics System
----

This one is my lifelong passion - or, put another way - something I've been stuck with for what seems like forever !

I don't know why - but for some reason, Sibelius and Scientific Computer Graphics grabbed my ass sometime in 1980 or so. And, to this date, almost 40 years later, they both still have control of me.

I should have known when, having dropped a stack of FORTRAN punch cards - yes - punch cards (and YES, FORTRAN), I studiously put them ALL back in order absolutely adament about saving that work - that I was forever in the 
unrelenting grip of software development and that I would never be free from it ! I wonder now, that if I could see the future 40 years hence from then, would I get the fuck out of there !? Prolly I should have - but alas, I did not!
