# The InnoVisioNate Graphics System
----

This one is my lifelong passion - or, put another way - something I've been stuck with for what seems like forever !

I don't know why - but for some reason, Sibelius and Scientific Computer Graphics grabbed my ass sometime in 1980 or so. And, to this date, almost 40 years later, they both still have full control over me.

I should have known when, having dropped a stack of FORTRAN punch cards - yes - punch cards (and YES, FORTRAN), I studiously put them ALL back in order absolutely adament about saving that work - that I was forever in the 
unrelenting grip of software development and that I would never ever be free from it ! I wonder now, that if at THAT point time I could see the future 40 years hence, would I get the fuck out of it right then and there !? 

I'll never know the answer to that - but I do know that for whatever angst, trials, and tribulations I've endured during these 40 years - if there will be some good that comes out of it - it may as well be a
contribution back to that realm that somehow roped me into this bullshit, irratitating, and frustrating career that I love so much...

And, so, here it is - number graphics - on Windows - in COM - and when I say COM - I mean COM.

## What is this software ?
----

At it's core - this is really a <strong>development</strong> tool. It is intended to be embedded into other systems by developers who want full featured number graphics at their fingertips. Yet it needs very little 
"container" support. In fact, the "application" that installs with this system is a very simple container of perhaps 100 or so lines of code. It is incredibly easy to pop this tool into just about any system imaginable. 
In fact, one can instantiate this directly in MS Excel with no programming at all ! It has been a lifelong goal of mine to rid the earth of those "Excel" charts you see everywhere - this does that nicely.

## Building the System
----
As I mentioned, this is COM. To further clarify, this is RAW COM.

All I can say is welcome to this incredibly powerful world ! Let me help you explore this world that MS doesn't have the courtesy to sufficiently document. Seems like all they wanted to do is provide the NEXT generation - 
having left THIS one in such poorly documented state that you'd HAVE to  buy the next !

But you will find - as I did - that it is ultimately SOoooo... simple.

So, my friends, join me in this - embrace the fact that software development of integrated systems is complex, yet, given a willingness to understand it, it becomes simple, elegant, robust, and extensible.

If what you want is cookie cutter, your hand held, it done for you, or some high level lowest common denominator one size fits all thing - well, then, please <strong>Move along - these are not the Droid's you're looking for</strong>

### Run the installer
----
You will find the NSIS built installer in the "Installer Support" directory. This installer will put a "Graphic" icon on your desktop. 
You can get to know how the system works quickly by right clicking on the empty graphic and choosing "Functions", then click "Add" to define a new function (default 3-D functions are provided).
