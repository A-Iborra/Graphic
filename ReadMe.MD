# The InnoVisioNate Graphics System
----

This one is my lifelong passion - or, put another way - something I've been stuck with for what seems like forever !

I don't know why - but for some reason, Sibelius and Scientific Computer Graphics grabbed my ass sometime in 1980 or so. And, to this date, almost 40 years later, they both still have full control over me.

I should have known when, having dropped a stack of FORTRAN punch cards - yes - punch cards (and YES, FORTRAN), I studiously put them ALL back in order absolutely adament about saving that work - that I was forever in the 
unrelenting grip of software development and that I would never ever be free from it ! I wonder now, that if at THAT point time I could see the future 40 years hence, would I get the fuck out of it right then and there !? 

I'll never know the answer to that - but I do know that for whatever angst, trials, and tribulations I've endured during these 40 years - if there will be some good that comes out of it - it may as well be a
contribution back to that realm that somehow roped me into this bullshit, irratitating, and frustrating career that I love so much...

And, so, here it is - number graphics - on Windows - in COM - and when I say COM - I mean COM.

## Building the System
----
As I mentioned, this is COM. To further clarify, this is RAW COM. There is nothing here, in terms of what you may <strong>THINK</strong> is COM, that you will recognize.

All I can say is welcome to this incredibly powerful world ! Let me help you explore this world that MS didn't have the balls or courtesy to describe to you, perhaps because they themselves never truly understood it ! 
Which would NOT surprise me! Or, perhaps because they didn't have as much faith in you that I have in you ! All THEY wanted to do is provide the NEXT generation - having left THIS one in such poorly documented state that you'd HAVE to 
buy the next !

But you will find - as I did - that it is ultimately SOoooo... simple, that it is an absolute afront to our intelligence that they would leave this stuff out !?! And, that to have our faculties insulted in this way should 
drive us incessently towards putting it right back in their face.

So, my friends, join me in this - embrace the fact that software development of integrated systems is complex, yet, given a willingness to understand it, it becomes simple, elegant, robust, and extensible.

If what you want is cookie cutter, your hand held, it done for you, or some high level lowest common denominator one size fits all thing - well, then, please <strong>Move along - these are not the Droid's you're looking for</strong>
