# The InnoVisioNate FunctioNater
----

This object can be used to generate data from any arbitray function you would like to define. For example, to drive the data input to the Graphic system - or, for any other reason you 
need to define and then execute some function.

I would point out that there is very detailed documentation for this component in the Documentation sub-directory. This was once a commercial software development product and those documents are product quality and very informative.
