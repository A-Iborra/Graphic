# The InnoVisioNate Graphics System Installer
----

You CAN just run this installer and use the system as an application. That installer is GraphicSetup.exe, of course. If that works for you, there is no need to actually build the system, it is all ready to go.

### Run the installer
----
This installer will put a "Graphic" icon on your desktop. 
You can get to know how the system works quickly by running this, then right clicking on the empty graphic and choosing "Functions", then click "Add" to define a new function (default 3-D functions are provided).
You can also integrate directly with excel. To do this, right click, choose properties, then DataSets. When you add a dataset you can import existing data from Excel workbooks.
You can also export datasets to Excel, the data generated,from a function, for example.
