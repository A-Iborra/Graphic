# The InnoVisioNate Graphics Host
----

ALL this is, is a simple application intended to show how to embedd the Graphic Control into some application (as a COM or ActiveX object).

However, as it turns out, being embedded in this way - causes THAT application to become a full featured scientific graphics package in it's own right. 
So - I figured, why not put two entire systems out there - one as an application - the other as the necessary tools to turn other applications into something with similar power !?

The only drawback that I can see is that sometimes people will assume the system IS one or the other of these two things - when it IS both - and, 
considering that developers can embed this technology into ANY system - it is actually, potentially, 100's of things !!! THAT is exciting to me !
