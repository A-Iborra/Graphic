# The InnoVisioNate Graphics Host
----

ALL this is, is just a simple sample application intended to show how to embedd the Graphic Control into some application (as a COM or ActiveX object).

However, it turns out that, being embedded in this simply application - turns THAT application into a full featured scientific graphics package - So - Why not just put two entire systems out there - one as an application - the other as 
the necessary tools to turn YOUR application into something with similar power !?

The only drawback that I can see is that sometimes people will assume the system IS one or the other of these two things - when it IS both - and, 
considering that developers can may ANY system to embed this technology - it is actually, potentially, 100's of things !!! THAT is exciting to me !
